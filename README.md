What is Data Science ?
- 
<p align="justify"> They help businesses to make impact utilizing big data. Big data is very quickly becoming a vital tool for businesses and companies of all sizes. The availability and interpretation of big data has altered the business models of old industries and enabled the creation of new ones. Data-driven businesses are worth $1.2 trillion collectively in 2020, an increase from $333 billion in the year 2015. Data scientists are responsible for breaking down big data into usable information and creating software and algorithms that help companies and organizations determine optimal operations. As big data continues to have a major impact on the world, data science does as well due to the close relationship between the two.

Do We need Data Science Team ?
-
<p align="justify"> Yes. If you are dealing with `fairly good amount of data` then adopting data science as the new company lifestyle is relevant. This data can be from Sales, Marketing, Advertisements, Production, Quality Assurance. Data Science can help you to look into this large amount of data, summarise it, learn from the data (as model), predict the outcomes for given senario and help you to make further descisions.

What Data Science can do and can't do for you?

Some signs you shouldn't be using #machinelearning / #ai:

*  if you're not intending to automate something
*  if you've got no data or small data
*  when you can look up the answer
*  if there's no pattern that connects inputs to outputs
*  if your data is nonstationary, you can find a recipe today but you're pretty sure it won't be relevant tomorrow (severe nonstationarity)

How do we begin to adopt Data Science ?
- 
- First we have to `define the objective` for Data Science Project
- Accourding to the defined goal we can start `collecting data`

Keys to successfully implement machine learning solutions in your organization

  1. **Machine learning is a cultural change**: The technology associated with machine learning and algorithms evolve very quickly, and it is not easy to keep up with them. The main change must, therefore, take place in the company culture: collaboration between the different business areas and the shared use of information must be encouraged in order for the implementation of machine learning to be successful.

  2. **Define an objective as clear and specific as possible**: It is important that the teams that are going to tackle the machine learning projects identify the problems that they want to face, applying the maximum degree of precision: for example, it is not the same to have the objective of increasing online sales by a certain percentage than to specify what is the desired Increase of online sales percentage by monitoring the site’s visitors.

  3. **Make sure you have reliable data**: data quality is essential for machine learning tools to carry out their work efficiently. If you opt for a supervised learning model, this source data must also be labeled so that the algorithm can learn to predict the correct exit label, in this case, the company must have previously implemented a sound and economically viable data acquisition and labeling strategy. If you opt for an unsupervised learning model, it will not be necessary to have labeled data, but it must be 100% reliable.

  4. **Trust an integrated platform**: the most profitable investment in a first machine learning project is the platform to carry it out. It is highly recommended to trust one with fully integrated tools, such as Google Cloud Platform, instead of building an application environment from different manufacturers and whose integration capacity is yet to be demonstrated. In the case of Google Cloud Platform, its specific tools for the development of machine learning projects are of great interest.

  5. **Always look for simplicity**: whenever possible, it is better to seek simplicity in any area of ​​a machine learning project than to build complex and expensive neural networks.

  6. **Start with small projects**: it is highly recommended to start with projects of small size or that address very specific points in the business processes. In this way, they will be executed and refined until the team can tackle larger machine learning projects, and you will discover other points to solve with machine learning tools.

  7. **Form multidisciplinary teams**: If the project is only developed by the IT team, the efficiency of the machine learning project is reduced. Bringing together the different business areas involved in the affected processes provides a larger umbrella of observation and adds fundamental considerations for the success of the project. These teams will decide the best way to achieve the proposed objective by implementing the following steps:
      -  **Algorithms**: useful for solving a class of new problems.
      -  **Libraries**: these are the ideal point that offers you the most flexibility such as TensorFlow, which allows you to create new machine learning models and solve unique business problems rapidly and in a user-friendly approach.
      -  **API**: the advantage of using packaged APIs if assigned directly to your need without requiring any modifications.
      -  **View, verify and control versions**: data is the fundamental part of a machine learning project, and to manage this huge volume of information, it is necessary to trust tools such as those offered by Google, such as Google Cloud Dataprep and BigQuery, to visualize the data and verify the results in each phase of the process. It is also important to apply version control, to clearly identify the data that is acted on and avoid costly mistakes.
